# Changelog

What changed in the Support desk, the example application of this
repository, newest first.

This file is the application's: the *Help › What changed* page shows
it first, then the framework's own, which ships inside the package -
[generic/CHANGELOG.md](generic/CHANGELOG.md). A project built on
django-generic keeps its changelog here, at its root, the same way.

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-25

The example released with django-generic 1.0.0: a small support desk
chosen to show every feature at work.

### Screens
- Tickets, customers, time entries, teams, agents and tags, declared by
  hand in `example/resources.py`: coloured tags, summary pages with
  figures, charts and related tables, inlines, bulk actions, presets.
- Suppliers, equipment and maintenance visits declared with two
  `auto()` lines.
- External services and their incidents, a status API's answer served
  by data resources, with a runbook page per service.
- Pages of their own: a map of the customers and the same as GeoJSON, a
  ticket's timeline.
- Triage and a ticket's hours as grids; the classic server-rendered
  views kept under `/demo/` for comparison.
- *Live updates*: what the connection behind every page carries, each
  frame with what it made happen, and channels of the project's own.

### Running it
- `seed_example` fills the desk with customers, a few hundred tickets,
  time entries, comments, a wiki, a welcome message to everyone and
  three users - `admin`, `viewer` and `guest`, password `demo`.
- Development and production settings, and a Docker stack for each.
- `debug.py`, the server under a debugger in one process, and the VS
  Code configurations for it - server, a command, the tests, a Celery
  worker, and attaching to the development stack in Docker.
